I also thought I'd look into the feasibility of quickly transferring .NET skills over to COBOL. Here are a few of the many resources I've come across, although I'm more interested in Intro to COBOL, so these might not be very useful for review.

https://newsroom.ibm.com/2020-04-09-IBM-and-Open-Mainframe-Project-Mobilize-to-Connect-States-with-COBOL-Skills
They state in the press release that they will be releasing details of a new video training series this week. Hopefully this will address Oleg's concerns about a lack of access to real mainframe resources for testing out new concepts.
An online COBOL playground can be found here:
https://www.tutorialspoint.com/compile_cobol_online.php
This seems to be a redirecting of STDOUT to a web page field. You can see the call to the compiler, and it appears as if the application is immediately run. Don't know how extensive typical COBOL assets are on the system, but it is a great way for a beginner to get started without cumbersome environment setup.
Speaking of environment, you can always download the gnuCOBOL compiler and execute programs locally. As Oleg mentions, this compiler doesn't include everything in the commercial versions available from IBM. However, gnuCOBOL works well Visual Studio Code, there are many videos explaining it on Youtube.
Another choice might be VisualCOBOL by Microfocus:
https://www.microfocus.com/en-us/products/visual-cobol/overview?utm_campaign=WQDGNFY2036828&utm_content=Search-Brand-AMC-VisualCobol-X-AMS-X-GGL-Exact&gclid=EAIaIQobChMI3cbgweLj6AIVIxvnCh1osQxUEAAYASAAEgI97PD_BwE
This is a full-featured extension and template for Visual Studio. This would make those of us who use VS daily feel a little less like we're in a foreign land.
And for the truly fearless, you can install what looks like a version of z/OS locally (again, just learning about these systems):
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6sK_BhVD8g
This video describes installing IBM MVS on Linux, but he also has a video describing a Windows installation.
I've seen video courses on pluralsight.com for both COBOL and JCL, but haven't watched them. Oleg is probably describing a series at Udemy, but there seem to multiple online courses available.
If someone is really adventurous, they may even check out sources like the Harvard Extension School, which is a very high quality (and expensive) series of courses taught be faculty. I know many top universities have similar offerings. And if you are truly unstoppable, you may be able to convince them to give you a hefty discount since you are tying to learn/review COBOL in order to volunteer and help out states and municipalities in desperate need of those skills.
Best of luck, and stay safe!

 Thank you all for your help. I am not sure if my lessons will help or even

I just wanted to highlight, that COBOL is a victim of legacy business model. Books and courses have nothing to do with it.
In XX we were building a computing room, purchasing the tools, licenses and terminals. An engineer comes with a problem and rents the infrastructure. He/she writes the code, debugs and executes it in the target environment. We may see this centralized approach in the tutorials and videos.
In XXI we have personal computing, decentralized tools, virtualization, local environments. Development on remote machines is considered archaic and counterproductive. Problem domain comes first, production infrastructure is very last thing.
How IBM supports COBOL tech-stack in new reality we may see in comparison with Java or .Net. As long as IBM jealously guards the production compiler and the execution runtime, no training courses will make COBOL great again.",thank -PRON- for feedback and the link i just want to highlight that cobol be a victim of legacy business model book and course have nothing to do with -PRON- in xx -PRON- be build a computing room purchase the tool license and terminal an engineer come with a problem and rent the infrastructure -PRON- / -PRON- write the code debug and execute -PRON- in the target environment -PRON- may see this centralized approach in the tutorial and video in xxi -PRON- have personal computing decentralize tool virtualization local environment development on remote machine be consider archaic and counterproductive problem domain come first production infrastructure be very last thing how ibm support cobol tech - stack in new reality -PRON- may see in comparison with java or net as long as ibm jealously guard the production compiler and the execution runtime no training course will make cobol great again,0

I have some background in Java, C#, PHP and JS. After reading the COBOL-calling posts last Friday, I decided to explore the new old-school tech-stack. Read Programmer's guide, Language reference, installed software and completed online training (actually 1.5 courses, to obtain IBM ID and Z/OS machine with ISPF and JCL on top). In addition to decimal math, I found the declarative validation and the representation of data in COBOL absolutely impressive.

In addition to decimal math, I found the declarative validation and the representation of data in COBOL absolutely impressive.

 If not, any takers on helping set one up?

 or is there a chain of tools (or notes on same) that allow us to use
 GnuCOBOL to complete the course (or will that be a different fork of this
 project?)

 cheers-

Command line interfaces can significantly improve development processes through the use of scripting. Zowe CLI is an open source tool that provides remote interaction with the mainframe and as an extensible technology, mainframe development products.
The Zowe CLI enables developers and DevOps engineers to control, script and develop on the mainframe like any other cloud platform and allows them to make use of familiar, industry-standard, open-source tooling. This helps address the skills gap and onboard COBOL developers by making mainframe development more attractive and accessible.
I intend to open a PR that adds a chapter introducing Zowe CLI, Zowe CLI Plug-ins, and how these technologies can help folks working with mainframe COBOL apps. It will also add a chapter on the installation of Zowe CLI and Plug-ins.

gnuCOBOL is open source. Is it reliable? Is it certified by any one or entity? Are there any unknown or unreported compiler errors lurking about?
(Enterprise) IBM COBOL is a commercial paid product offering. The full faith of the IBM Corporation stands behind it, and a version of IBM COBOL has been offered/licensed for use for at least 50+ years!  Large institutions (e.g. publicly traded companies), especially where large monetary/financial transactions are involved, rely on the maturity of IBM COBOL to be free of compiler errors, that could be costly if undetected for any period of time. IBM does not publish the compiler source code, so there is no way for a customer’s programmer (of a licensee) to change the compiler, for any reason. This is a definite advantage, in the scope of a financial audit of a publicly traded company performed by a large accounting firm, performing such an audit to ensure the accuracy of a company’s financial statements.
Enterprise IBM COBOL is designed to run in an IBM mainframe environment, with the I/O custom to that environment.

gnuCOBOL is open source. Is it reliable? Is it certified by any one or entity? Are there any unknown or unreported compiler errors lurking about?
(Enterprise) IBM COBOL is a commercial paid product offering. The full faith of the IBM Corporation stands behind it, and a version of IBM COBOL has been offered/licensed for use for at least 50+ years!  Large institutions (e.g. publicly traded companies), especially where large monetary/financial transactions are involved, rely on the maturity of IBM COBOL to be free of compiler errors, that could be costly if undetected for any period of time. IBM does not publish the compiler source code, so there is no way for a customer’s programmer (of a licensee) to change the compiler, for any reason. This is a definite advantage, in the scope of a financial audit of a publicly traded company performed by a large accounting firm, performing such an audit to ensure the accuracy of a company’s financial statements.
Enterprise IBM COBOL is designed to run in an IBM mainframe environment, with the I/O custom to that environment.
I believe gnuCOBOL is designed to run in non-IBM controlled environments, so the I/O will be different.  Other than I/O, the language capabilities and syntax should be similar.

Hope that helped!

Auditing programs is a necessary function of a financial audit perform by a large accounting firm of a publicly traded company to certify the accuracy of the company’s financial statements. The Cobol language was designed for transactional business data processing. It was never intended to be used for Android development, for example. If you need scientific functions, Cobol is probably not the best choice of language. However, Cobol has many built-in functions, or it can call another program, written in another language, like Fortran (a scientific language which was used to make the precise calculations necessary to send astronauts to the moon), or it can call numerous functions/subroutines in IBM’s Language Environment (LE). These same LE common subroutines can be called from many of IBM’s supported languages. So, keep an open mind, follow the class materials and remember, different languages are best suited for the types of problems they were originally designed to solve.

You see, you cannot use a ""DISPLAY"" type definition within a COMPUTE statement.  A character, such as ""$"" or ""."", makes your GROSS-PAY variable a ""DISPLAY"" type variable.  The proper way to use ""DISPLAY"" type variables is to MOVE a value to it, after calculating it using a numeric defined variable.  So, your GROSS-PAY could be defined as PIC 9(5)V99 and then moved to a new variable, GROSS-PAY-DISPLAY PIC $(4)9.99. The ""V"" represents an implied decimal point.  The new definition means, print a ""$"" immediately to the left of the first significant number (greater than zero), within a 4-byte field.  The ""9.99"", means print all digits, when the value contained in this variable is less than 10.00.  This is a technique to ensure zero is printed as ""0.00"" or in this case, ""$0.00"".

Have you tried making GROSS-PAY display like this: $1,234.56?  Give that a whirl.
Make the number 123 display as $123.00.  Make ZERO display as $0.00, or just 0.00, but not 00000.00.

The SEARCH verb (sequential and binary variations) is used quite often in Cobol programs.  Interview question: ""Explain table handling in Cobol.""  Hint: Use the SEARCH verb and the REDEFINES clause in the DATA DIVISION.
Study 88 level items in the DATA DIVISION, what they are and how to use them. Also involves the SET verb.
INSPECT and INSPECT REPLACING (older IBM pre-COBOL II compilers used EXAMINE), is used quite often.
Making 2 fields print on the same line together (e.g. first and last name) without blank space in between, is also a concept.  Hint:  use the STRING verb.
Study the UNSTRING verb.
Look at the COBOL Language Reference Manual, and study all the available reserved words in Chapter 20. Learn their purpose and what they do. IBM Cobol Language Reference Manual v6.3 http://publibfp.boulder.ibm.com/epubs/pdf/igy6lr30.pdf.
Study the Cobol intrinic functions available, Chapter 21 of the same manual.
Don't ever use the GO TO verb, no need to use it.
Don't ever use the ALTER (GO TO) verb, and pray you don't run into any programs that do.
Avoid tying your program up in ""NOT""s (for non-English speakers, this is a play on words; the word ""not"" vs. the word ""knot""), i.e. don't ever use NOT in conditional statements, or at least very sparingly.  You can use CONTINUE (nop in other languages) to accomplish the same thing with positive, rather than negative logic.
Study the case structure verb, EVALUATE, EVALUATE TRUE, and EVALUATE variable-name.  Be sure to use WHEN OTHER as a final condition in an EVALUATE statement.
Next, you should familiarize yourself with JCL.  Study the examples.  z/OS MVS JCL Reference v2r3, https://www-01.ibm.com/servers/resourcelink/svc00100.nsf/pages/zOSV2R3SA231385/$file/ieab600_v2r3.pdf
Then after all that, study the DFSORT manual (and also ICETOOL).  Sorting (using DFSORT or a 3rd party software product, e.g. SYNCSORT is very common) is heavily used in commercial (real world) environments. If you only learn one general use utility, this is the one to learn.  DFSORT Application Programming Guide, v2r3, https://www-01.ibm.com/servers/resourcelink/svc00100.nsf/pages/zOSV2R3sc236878/$file/icea100_v2r3.pdf  Most of you here probably already know how to program in other languages better than I.

I agree. CSV has a different length and I guess I should have said allocate a sequential dataset and upload it to mainframe. I didn't mean to upload it the *.CBL dataset. Thank you for the clarification. I will keep this in mind.

Making a HTTP request directly to API and processing of received JSON would be the best way to.

I agree. I decided to write a different program to do this. It is a combination of Typescript and Zowe CLI.

FAQ:

""I'm having a very hard time connecting with the mainframe.  What should I do?""

Post your .yaml file in the Slack Channel Forum, but don't post any passwords. .yaml location: C:\Users<your Win Id>.zowe\profiles\zosmf\LearnCOBOL.yaml  Hopefully, someone can help you spot the problem.
Try shutting down VSCode and relaunch.
If that doesn't work, shut down VSCode, try deleting the .yaml file, relauch and create a New Connection again.  Eventually, it will work.  Very buggy.
Also, you could have timed out, if you've connected before.  Need to re-Authenticate.  Shut down VSCode and relaunch.
If clicking on the ""Refresh All"" icon to the right of ""DATA SETS"" or the ""Search Data Sets..."" icon to the right of ""LearnCOBOL"" (also in the ""DATA SETS"" area) and nothing happens, try clicking on ""LearnCOBOL"" itself in the ""JOBS"" area.  This version (v0.4.9) of Z Open Editor is buggy.  If you receive, ""Check Credentials"" (Blue pop-up box appears), click it, re-authenticate at top.  Ignore any ""rse"" error messages. Continue anyway.
Other things to try, watch this video.  The presenter actually walks through the process, although I think it was with an older, more stable version of IBM Z Open Editor.  Get hands on! Run a COBOL program - Webinar - Originally broadcast: 2020-04-24 - 40 minutes

Note: IBM DFSORT's ICETOOL can often replace the need to write COBOL program(s), when needing to (optionally) sort and tranform data contained in one or more input files to produce an output file.  All user guides written by Frank L. Yaeger on this subject are excellent.  Access the entire collection, here.

I think what is happening, is people have found out about this course via all sorts of different methods, and there is no one place that has all of the above needed information.  The return email would be a good place (although not the only place) where such information should/could be found.
Really enjoying the course and the Cobol Community that you have formed!
Keep up the good work!
Thank you,

https://github.com/openmainframeproject/cobol-programming-course,cobol-programming-course,openmainframeproject,53,2020-04-22T21:05:04Z,sccosel,Update Needed to Return Email containing Credentials,https://github.com/openmainframeproject/cobol-programming-course/issues/53,"After someone requests their credentials: here
The return email should direct them: here
and instruct them to (or suggest they) download the PDF Version of the class instruction manual (materials), COBOL Programming with VSCode.  The free Acrobat Reader can be downloaded if needed to view the .pdf file.  Note: The .md version is the official, up-to-the-minute updated version of the class materials.  The .pdf version is generated from the .md version on a regular basis, so it may not reflect the most up-to-date changes.  A version number/date to be published within the .pdf document has been proposed by project participants, so currently, it is not easily determinable if the .pdf version includes the absolute most recent updates and corrections made to the .md version.
Also a reminder to please follow the instructions, STEP by STEP and to always substitute their Z8xxxx id, issued above, in place of the example id, Z99998, wherever it is mentioned in the class instruction manual.
Also, the return email should include the following IP addresses needed for the course, and explain that the class instruction manual will explain when they will be needed:
IP address for VSCode extension: https://192.86.32.250:10443 <== This link is not meant to be clicked!
IP address for TN3270: 192.86.32.250 Port 623
IP address for IDz: 192.86.32.250 Port 4035
Additionally, the slack channel should be mentioned, for questions and discussion: here
FAQ:

""I'm having a very hard time connecting with the mainframe.  What should I do?""

Post your .yaml file in the Slack Channel Forum, but don't post any passwords. .yaml location: C:\Users<your Win Id>.zowe\profiles\zosmf\LearnCOBOL.yaml  Hopefully, someone can help you spot the problem.
Try shutting down VSCode and relaunch.
If that doesn't work, shut down VSCode, try deleting the .yaml file, relauch and create a New Connection again.  Eventually, it will work.  Very buggy.
Also, you could have timed out, if you've connected before.  Need to re-Authenticate.  Shut down VSCode and relaunch.
If clicking on the ""Refresh All"" icon to the right of ""DATA SETS"" or the ""Search Data Sets..."" icon to the right of ""LearnCOBOL"" (also in the ""DATA SETS"" area) and nothing happens, try clicking on ""LearnCOBOL"" itself in the ""JOBS"" area.  This version (v0.4.9) of Z Open Editor is buggy.  If you receive, ""Check Credentials"" (Blue pop-up box appears), click it, re-authenticate at top.  Ignore any ""rse"" error messages. Continue anyway.
Other things to try, watch this video.  The presenter actually walks through the process, although I think it was with an older, more stable version of IBM Z Open Editor.  Get hands on! Run a COBOL program - Webinar - Originally broadcast: 2020-04-24 - 40 minutes

The .pdf version is generated from the .md version on a regular basis, so it may not reflect the most up-to-date changes.  A version number/date to be published within the .pdf document has been proposed by project participants, so currently, it is not easily determinable if the .pdf version includes the absolute most recent updates and corrections made to the .md version.
Also a reminder to please follow the instructions, STEP by STEP and to always substitute their Z8xxxx id, issued above, in place of the example id, Z99998, wherever it is mentioned in the class instruction manual.
Also, the return email should include the following IP addresses needed for the course, and explain that the class instruction manual will explain when they will be needed:
IP address for VSCode extension: https://192.86.32.250:10443 <== This link is not meant to be clicked!
IP address for TN3270: 192.86.32.250 Port 623
IP address for IDz: 192.86.32.250 Port 4035
Additionally, the slack channel should be mentioned, for questions and discussion: here
FAQ:

""I'm having a very hard time connecting with the mainframe.  What should I do?""

Post your .yaml file in the Slack Channel Forum, but don't post any passwords. .yaml location: C:\Users<your Win Id>.zowe\profiles\zosmf\LearnCOBOL.yaml  Hopefully, someone can help you spot the problem.
Try shutting down VSCode and relaunch.
If that doesn't work, shut down VSCode, try deleting the .yaml file, relauch and create a New Connection again.  Eventually, it will work.  Very buggy.
Also, you could have timed out, if you've connected before.  Need to re-Authenticate.  Shut down VSCode and relaunch.
If clicking on the ""Refresh All"" icon to the right of ""DATA SETS"" or the ""Search Data Sets..."" icon to the right of ""LearnCOBOL"" (also in the ""DATA SETS"" area) and nothing happens, try clicking on ""LearnCOBOL"" itself in the ""JOBS"" area.  This version (v0.4.9) of Z Open Editor is buggy.  If you receive, ""Check Credentials"" (Blue pop-up box appears), click it, re-authenticate at top.  Ignore any ""rse"" error messages. Continue anyway.
Other things to try, watch this video.  The presenter actually walks through the process, although I think it was with an older, more stable version of IBM Z Open Editor.  Get hands on! Run a COBOL program - Webinar - Originally broadcast: 2020-04-24 - 40 minutes

I think what is happening, is people have found out about this course via all sorts of different methods, and there is no one place that has all of the above needed information.  The return email would be a good place (although not the only place) where such information should/could be found.

Work directly on Mission Critical COBOL code without getting prior experience. That is , When  a person starts as a fresher , he will get  experience by working in small software companies who develop smaller apps.Then ,he will migrate to big companies who handles large project.But In COBOL , there is no chance for that .none of the small and medium level companies don't develop any COBOL based systems .Only Big companies running COBOL , and all of them are mission critical code that should be handled by experienced people .So how a developer able to get real world experience in COBOL before going to big companies  ?


COBOL's community support is very low. It's difficult to get a immediate help from a friend in COBOL issue by calling him by phone , since there is low possibility of having experienced COBOL developer as a friend because  experienced COBOL developers are 2 generations above from modern ""born in 90s"" generation .


Non Openness . The IBM Enterprise COBOL is locked inside mainframes and there is no way to run the code in home system Even though IBM mainframe access is free and also good , it's not that much practical to learn without having access to the whole system . He must have internet connection etc . And running a high quality code by a developer in this free main frame access in not possible .For example , I ran 14 GB ram consuming python ML code that ran for 2 hours in my Home PC without any problem . How can a developer explore the same scenario in this mainframe access ?


Practically useless gnuCOBOL .    One can use gnuCOBOL to avoid above 2nd point issue . But gnuCOBOL is having many differences when compared to IBM COBOL and no companies using gnuCOBOL in any real world mission critical code .


One need to learn JCL and mainframe ecosystem to learn COBOL , None the language I know such as Java,Kotlin, Javascript , Dart don't have this type of issue.


Jobs . COBOL having very less job listing when searching in job sites like Naukri , Indeed etc

3. You are trying to relate your current knowledge and job assignments to Cobol.  Relax.  IBM is providing you with a unique opportunity, offering free mainframe ""computer time"" on a real (not emulated one as confirmed by @paulnewt) IBM Mainframe (probably located in Dallas, TX).  Use this OPPORTUNITY to learn the basic foundations of COBOL, JCL, TSO/ISPF, DFSORT/ICETOOL, DB2 (if available), etc. etc. etc.  There are plenty of videos, online and paid classes that you can take, and use the mainframe access IBM is providing, to learn them all.  Consider taking IBM's free, Master the Mainframe course.  I think the 2019 version is still available.  Sign up and go through that while the 2020 course is being prepared to launch.  Again, ask lots of questions, especially on the Slack Channel!


As long as you have access to an IBM mainframe as mentioned in number 3, above, forget about gnuCOBOL for now.  You've got access to the latest, most up to date version of COBOL, from IBM!

But  I want to discuss about some issues
** issues**


Work directly on Mission Critical COBOL code without getting prior experience. That is , When  a person starts as a fresher , he will get  experience by working in small software companies who develop smaller apps.Then ,he will migrate to big companies who handles large project.But In COBOL , there is no chance for that .none of the small and medium level companies don't develop any COBOL based systems .Only Big companies running COBOL , and all of them are mission critical code that should be handled by experienced people .So how a developer able to get real world experience in COBOL before going to big companies  ?


COBOL's community support is very low. It's difficult to get a immediate help from a friend in COBOL issue by calling him by phone , since there is low possibility of having experienced COBOL developer as a friend because  experienced COBOL developers are 2 generations above from modern ""born in 90s"" generation .


Non Openness . The IBM Enterprise COBOL is locked inside mainframes and there is no way to run the code in home system Even though IBM mainframe access is free and also good , it's not that much practical to learn without having access to the whole system . He must have internet connection etc . And running a high quality code by a developer in this free main frame access in not possible .For example , I ran 14 GB ram consuming python ML code that ran for 2 hours in my Home PC without any problem . How can a developer explore the same scenario in this mainframe access ?


Practically useless gnuCOBOL .    One can use gnuCOBOL to avoid above 2nd point issue . But gnuCOBOL is having many differences when compared to IBM COBOL and no companies using gnuCOBOL in any real world mission critical code .


One need to learn JCL and mainframe ecosystem to learn COBOL , None the language I know such as Java,Kotlin, Javascript , Dart don't have this type of issue.


Jobs . COBOL having very less job listing when searching in job sites like Naukri , Indeed etc

There should only be 2 periods per paragraph, 1 at the end of the paragraph name, and 1 on a blank line of its own at the end of the paragraph.
Always use GOBACK instead of STOP-RUN.
No need to use PERFORM THRU or EXIT paragraphs.
No need to use GOTOs.  Use an IF statement and CONTINUE to check the (88-level) value of LASTREC to conditionally execute the PERFORM.  Or, since you will only use 1 period within a paragraph, NEXT SENTENCE will take you to the end of the paragraph.
A READ or WRITE paragraph should be limited to just a READ of a file or WRITE of a record. Optionally, one group MOVE statement.  The purpose of this type of paragraph is to be versatile enough to be able to perform it multiple times from different parts/areas of your program.

I'm currently experiencing some issues installing and running IBM Developer on my Mac Book running Catalina. Anyone have similar issues? It appears that my machine meets all of the HW/SW pre-reqs. I've tried both various install methods: IBM IM, eclipse p2, and installing directly from Eclipse software.
Whenever I download and unzip the IM file, I see a folder entitled ""aqua-3.1-im-1.9.1-macosx-x86_64"" with various folders. If I try to open any of the application files in this folder, I either receive a message indicating the file is damaged or one saying that ""developer can't be verified.""
If downloaded using the Eclipse p2 method, it will unzip showing the IBM Developer application, but upon opening, it gave me a message saying ""unable to locate companion shared library.""
Lastly, I tried installing via Eclipse software and was again unsuccessful.
Any help would be greatly appreciated.

How should we develop advanced content for the course without going out of scope?
How should we handle multiple vendors requesting inclusion of commercial tooling in the space?

I believe the primary goals of the current course are:

Provide introductory content on how to get started with COBOL on z/OS
Leverage free publicly available client tooling to interact with the environment allowing participants to easily leverage the technologies after the course. Embrace choice of open tooling.
Build a community - thank you all! :)

For advanced content, including testing and a vetted list of challenges, perhaps additional books should be published. After completing the course, participants frequently ask about what is next. The community has helped point them in various directions. I propose we begin authoring additional books/guides to help participants continue their journey.
For commercial tooling, additional books should be published. Vendors could consider contributing content that allows a participant to complete the lab using their tooling/environment.
In a future PR, I intend to:

Refactor the testing section of the book into a draft of a new book
Refactor the section on IDz into a draft of a new book. This will provide guidance for other vendors looking to include their commercial tooling in this space.",,,,,,0

And I'm not really sure about storage capacity too. So I was thinking about using the included DATA dataset for this. Something like this for the logic part:
       LOAD-TABLES.

           PERFORM VARYING TABLE-VAR FROM 1 BY 1
             UNTIL TABLE-VAR = TABLE-MAX OR END-OF-FILE

       SEARCH-RECORD.
           SET TABLE-IDX TO 1.
           SEARCH ALL ACCT-TABLE-ITEM

               WHEN ACCT-NO (TABLE-IDX) = 18011809
                   DISPLAY ""User with Acct No 18011809 is found!"".","that would work i think but -PRON- concern be this course never really discuss about table in depth and -PRON- may be weird to jump straight into search without explain about table and -PRON- be not really sure about storage capacity too so i be think about use the include datum dataset for this something like this for the logic part load - table perform read - record perform varying table - var from 1 by 1 until table - var = table - max or end - of - file move acct - field to acct - table - item ( table - var ) perform read - record end - perform * search - record set table - idx to 1 search all acct - table - item at end display "" not find "" when acct - no ( table - idx ) = 18011809 display "" user with acct no 18011809 be find """,0

As a matter of fact, the only time tables are mentioned is on the paragraph detailing the SEARCH statements.
But then, adding table handling to Course 1 when it's already released on many different platforms seems counterproductive (my fear being those that took the course on the other platform might go here and say ""Wait, why don't we have those on < put platform name here >?"").
With that in mind, should we explore adding this to Course 2 instead?
Anyway, feedbacks are welcomed! CBLSRCH1 explores doing a SEARCH and CBLSRCH2 explores SEARCH ALL. Both codes uses the existing ZXXXXX.DATA so that we don't need to create any new dataset.

how much electricity has been wasted by numerous people having to compile the pdfs, and download the supporting software?
Why not a format that's easily usable, and lightweight like HTML instead? Would that offend the open-source gods who demand fealty to the make-it-as-difficult-as-possible-so-we-feel-superior rule? Or is posting a LaTex file way more cool, and possibly impressive to the ""open sores"" crowd?
Why did I have to download THREE software packages I will NEVER use again, for THREE pdfs? Especially considering lightweight alternatives were easily available.
Why did the creator of this course not give one minute of thought to the user of this ""course?"" Was usability not even considered?
Why PDF? the idea of PDFs is to stop the end-user from  changing the info. That is NOT necessary here.

reason:   17

message:  Submit input data does not start with a slash

Furthermore, JCLs are crucial for submitting jobs which compile, link-edit and run their COBOL code.
Given that, I think it will be nice for us to add a short non-technical introduction to JCL, why is it necessary, etc. at the beginning of the course. Currently the first brief definition of JCL and its function are at Line 2013 of Course 1, at the ASSIGN Clause section. But by then the course taker would have submitted a few JCLs.
Maybe we can adapt the first paragraph on the IBM Knowledge Center? It doesn't have to be too in-depth, but as long as the course taker understand that JCL is there for them to run jobs which compile their code, and thus understand why they are submitting that instead of the COBOL codes, it will be great.",,,,,,0

It would be nice if this file were hyperlinked to avoid hunting for it.

The lab files are not hyperlinked because they are meant to be taken on a lab system. If you haven't, you can sign up for the course's lab system at https://ibm.biz/cobollabs.
Regarding the line numbers, we are planning an update to the course which should be out in the coming months, and I'll make sure that the line numbers mentioned on the PDF match to those in the system and in the GitHub files.
Thanks for mentioning this!",hi leo the lab file be not hyperlinked because -PRON- be mean to be take on a lab system if -PRON- have not -PRON- can sign up for the course 's lab system at https//ibmbiz / cobollabs regard the line number -PRON- be plan an update to the course which should be out in the coming month and -PRON- will make sure that the line number mention on the pdf match to those in the system and in the github file thank for mention this,0
