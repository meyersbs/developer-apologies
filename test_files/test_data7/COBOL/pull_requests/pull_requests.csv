Zowe CLI is an open source tool that provides remote interaction with the mainframe and as an extensible technology, mainframe development products.
The Zowe CLI enables developers and DevOps engineers to control, script and develop on the mainframe like any other cloud platform and allows them to make use of familiar, industry-standard, open-source tooling. This helps address the skills gap and onboard COBOL developers by making mainframe development more attractive and accessible.
This PR address issue #31 by adding:

Chapter 3. Zowe CLI and Zowe CLI Plug-ins

Explains what a CLI is and why you would use it, how to use Zowe CLI interactively, how to abstract CLI commands into useful scripts, and how Zowe CLI enables the use of familiar open source tooling while developing COBOL applications on the mainframe.


Chapter 5. Installation of Zowe CLI and Plug-ins

Covers all aspects of the download and installation of Zowe CLI and Zowe CLI plug-ins.

Chapter 3. Zowe CLI and Zowe CLI Plug-ins

Explains what a CLI is and why you would use it, how to use Zowe CLI interactively, how to abstract CLI commands into useful scripts, and how Zowe CLI enables the use of familiar open source tooling while developing COBOL applications on the mainframe.


Chapter 5. Installation of Zowe CLI and Plug-ins

But I think there's some issues here:

Originally, before #153, CBL0003J is a JCL which is intentionally designed to have a bug, in which it executes CBL0001 but with an incorrect DD name
Klaus then submitted #153, in which he added a COBOL program which he called CBL0003 and the corresponding JCL CBL0003J, which is designed to explain subroutine calls. Since CBL0003J already existed previously, he renamed the old one (which is buggy) to CBL0033J.
However, this causes some issues since the Lab files on both Coursera and IBM Learning Platform still references the buggy JCL as CBL0003J instead of its new name, CBL0033J. Thus, in order to maintain compatibility with prior docs out there, I open this pull request.

Basically what this pull request did is bring back the renamed JCL to CBL0003J and changes Klaus' COBOL and JCL to adopt the CBL0033 naming. But the update basically removed the buggy JCL and put an exact copy of CBL0001 as CBL0003, so Klaus' code is still not on the system.

Could not duplicate them (gives me empty output) so I used the old images




If you want, you can duplicate zowe-cli-zos-files-list-ds-command using zowe files list ds ""Z99998.*"" and zowe-cli-jobs-submit-ds-command"" using zowe jobs submit ds ""Z99998.JCL(HELLO)"" --wait-for-output

Additionally, checking the list of available compiler options and input-output data sets for the compiler are left as exercises for the course taker. Although we may choose to provide a highlight of some important compiler options.

Typo in image001: TBLANACE-O.
Missing a . at the last line on image002.
Typo in image106: heigher. Also, we may want to check that the chapter number mentioned is correct, and I believe the file name of the FD statement should begins in area B.
Typo in image107: PRINT_REC. Chapter numbering seems wrong when compared to the current list, and I believe the file name of the FD statement should begins in area B.
Typo in image108: fiftheen, postions. Also, the COMPUTE statement is missing, and the column numbering on the third line is off. We may also want to check that the figure number and page is correct.

Typo in image131: LASTRIC = 'Y', PERFORM WRIYR-RECORD. Also, it will be nice if the arrow can be consistent (either just a arrowed line, or a filled arrow, or a hollow arrow).
Typo in image141: &SYSSUID.DATA, CBL001J.
Typo in image142: decribes, CBL001J. Also, variable name should be plural (i.e. variable names). And I believe the file name of the FD statement should begins in area B.
