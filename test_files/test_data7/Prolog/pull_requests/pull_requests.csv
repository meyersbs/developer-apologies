A possible alternative is to define and use an alias other than library. E.g. terminus_core.

% applies the Logtalk linter to all terminus-server
% modules files that are loaded 
%
% usage:
%	$ swilgt start.pl
%	?- {loader}.

:- initialization((
	set_logtalk_flag(report, warnings),
	logtalk_load([os(loader), types(loader)]),
	logtalk_load_context(directory, Directory),
	findall(
		File,

You can experiment with it after installing Logtalk (latest version is recommended, currently at 3.36.0). Note that it will generate several warnings that are safe to ignore. It will also fail to lint a few modules due to compilation errors as they require manual patches to allow them to be compiled as objects. Those patches are not bugs in the modules but rather differences between objects and modules (notably, Logtalk is not based on a predicate prefixing mechanism as found in module systems). For example:
!     Domain error: value prolog_frame_attribute(+,+,:) is not in domain meta_predicate_template
!       in clause for predicate report_curl_command/1
!       in file /Users/pmoura/terminus-server/core/util/test_utils.pl between lines 130-135

The patch here would be to add before the clause triggering the error:
:- meta_predicate(prolog_frame_attribute(*,*,*)).
But such patch would cause issues and thus no point in submitting it.
There are also a few false warnings regarding dict goals (no current workaround due to the way SWI-Prolog currently implements dicts). An example is:
*     Goal is always false: A.instance_read_objects=[B]
*       while compiling object database
*       in file /Users/pmoura/terminus-server/core/transaction/database.pl between lines 238-272

When the goal is checked, the SWI-Prolog compiler have not yet compiled the dict call.
Anyway, give it a try.

https://github.com/terminusdb/terminusdb,terminusdb,terminusdb,259,2021-03-19T22:17:38Z,rrooij,Fix very slow query when using ./terminusdb list with many dbs,https://github.com/terminusdb/terminusdb/pull/259,"I created 388 DBs and it took 90 seconds to list them. But when I fix this query, it takes around 6 seconds. The reason is that the
original query is very slow because it does not take account that Db_Uri could be ground already.
To reproduce the bad performance, create: 388 DBs or something similar:
#!/usr/bin/env python3
from terminusdb_client import WOQLClient, WOQLQuery

amount = 388
client = WOQLClient('https://127.0.0.1:6363')
client.connect(user='admin', account='admin', key='root')

for x in range(0, amount):
    db_name = f'db{str(x)}'
    client.create_database(db_name, accountid=""admin"")
Then run ./terminusdb list. As you can see it is very slow.
Apply my commit and it runs way faster.",,,,,,0,0

is the super_user/admin, there is no need to get the user object
and query the organization of every database.
However, even when a specific user wants a list of their DBs
it is also faster now. Since the name of the database is already
in the user object itself, it does not need to be queried.
This saves addiontal time and also removes the need for the
ground check of the DB URI.
Time went from:
./terminusdb list  6.30s user 1.87s system 103% cpu 7.912 total

When typing:
curl -X PUT -H ""Content-Type: application/json"" -u ""admin:root"" ""http://localhost:6363/api/document/admin/test563?graph_type=schema&author=me&message=me"" --data-binary '{ ""@base"": ""http://example.com/elements/"", ""@documentation"": {""@authors"": [""Gavin Mendel-Gleason""], ""@description"": ""This collection gives the periodic table of the elements with all isotopes together with their names, symbols and masses"", ""@title"": ""Periodic Table of the Elements""}, ""@schema"": ""http://example.com/elements#"", ""@type"": ""@context""}'

The output is:
[""@context"" ]

In order to use POST with this, the flag for full replacement should be set to 'true':
curl -X POST -H ""Content-Type: application/json"" -u ""admin:root"" ""http://localhost:6363/api/document/admin/test563?graph_type=schema&author=me&message=me&full_replace=true"" --data-binary '{""@base"": ""http://example.com/elements/"", ""@documentation"": {""@authors"": [""Gavin Mendel-Gleason""], ""@description"": ""This collection gives the periodic table of the elements with all isotopes together with their names, symbols and masses"", ""@title"": ""Periodic Table of the Elements""}, ""@schema"": ""http://example.com/elements#"", ""@type"": ""@context""}'

This returns an empty list:
[]

To check if the methods above work, use:
curl -X GET -H ""Content-Type: application/json"" -u ""admin:root"" ""http://localhost:6363/api/document/admin/test563?graph_type=schema""

or add minimized=false  at the end of the http for nice printing:
curl -X GET -H ""Content-Type: application/json"" -u ""admin:root"" ""http://localhost:6363/api/document/admin/test563?graph_type=schema&minimized=false""

This returns:
{
  ""@base"":""http://example.com/elements/"",
  ""@documentation"": {
    ""@authors"": [""Gavin Mendel-Gleason"" ],
    ""@description"":""This collection gives the periodic table of the elements with all isotopes together with their names, symbols and masses"",

This now follows the following algorithm:

For all 4, if there's just a single value, it is treated exactly as if this was a required field. This ensures that the same id is generated, so that in the future, it may be possible to switch between key strategies without having to convert existing objects that are already in line with the new format, such as when going from optional to set, or from required to optional.
For all 4, if there is no value, the out-of-band value '+' '+none+' (unencoded) is used
For the list-like types with more than one value, the values are concatenated with an unencoded '++' between them. In case of sets, the list is first sorted to ensure that documents who order the list differently but contain the same values still get the same id.

Work in progress as I explore some more edge cases.

The new logger allows structured logging of json structures by severity, and will make an effort to associate each log entry with an ongoing request.
Through the environment variable TERMINUSDB_LOG_LEVEL, the desired log level can be set. this can be one of DEBUG, INFO, NOTICE, WARNING or ERROR. The default is INFO. Anything below the desired log level is omitted from the log.
Through the environment variable TERMINUSDB_LOG_FORMAT, the desired log format can be set. By default this is text, which will just print the log severity, a timestamp and the log message (provided those fields exist in the structured log record). By setting it to json, the full structured log record is printed instead.
This log format should be compatible with google cloud logging.
Currently, log records are made for the following cases:

request start (info)
request end (info)
descriptor open (debug)
descriptor commit (debug)
uncaught errors (error)",2021-09-23T12:00:07Z,matko,https://github.com/terminusdb/terminusdb/pull/606#issuecomment-925744293,"Open question is whether or not the http requests are logged correctly.

When operation id and request id are different (which happens when a client submits an X-Operation-ID header), we therefore lost information about the particular request a log record was part of. Since multiple requests may share the same operation id (such as when multiple database operations logically make up a single operation from a user perspective), this information is required for proper grouping.
With this pull request, it's now included in every log entry, much like how this happens with the operation id.",,,,,,0,0
